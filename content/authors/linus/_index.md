<h2>About Linus</h2>
<p>
I'm currently doing my PhD with my supervisor <a href="/author/kostas-papagiannopoulos/">Kostas Papagiannopoulos</a>, where I'm working on Side-Channel attacks, countermeasures against them, and the efficient and secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms on platforms like RISC-V.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not working, I love to go bouldering both indoors and outdoors or play (board) games with friends.
