<h2> About Damian</h2>
<p>
  I am fascinated by programming languages: they are the optimal form of abstraction. Hence, making it easier to construct new programming languages is the main focus of my research. As part of this effort, I want to integrate the design process with exploratory programming --- a style of programming where the goal worked towards is not fully concrete. This integration enables a highly volatile style of language development, making it easy to try out different design choices and reach the optimal language earlier.

<p>
 If you're still reading and are curious about me personally: I am born and raised in Almere, the Netherlands. Or, as I would like to say, the most beautiful city in the Netherlands. In my spare time, I enjoy taking a walk, cycle, and meet friends to have a drink.
