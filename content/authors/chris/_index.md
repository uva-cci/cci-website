<H2>About Christopher</H2>
<p>
  I am a Post-doc researcher developing (languages for) formal specifications of distributed systems.


  Namely, well-made specification (languages) have various uses: (1) using a language by writing a specification helps us to structure and interrogate our understanding of our systems, (2) specifications are discrete, communicable artefacts, whose clear semantics make them good vehicles for recording and communicating our expectations, requirements, and observations in an unambiguous form, and (3) having a specification lets us find and prove (subtle) emergent properties of our systems.
</p>
<p>
  My work My work revolves around the design and experimentation with languages and specifications, as motivated by some practical applications. In the last few years, we have applied these languages and specifications to the regulation of agent behaviour in in inter-organisational medical data processing, and in ad hoc, multi-party network transactions.
