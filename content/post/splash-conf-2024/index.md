Members of the [Complex Cyber Infrastructure](https://cci-research.nl/) group have been hard at work on the topic of software languages, developing methods and tools improving the productivity and control of programmers and language-designers.
The latest contributions are being published in three articles, which will each be presented at [SPLASH 2024](https://2024.splashcon.org/) in Pasadena, California.
Each contribution provides a piece of the puzzle of developing large and complex software systems:
1. Bridging Incremental Programming and Complex Software Development Environments
	- to be presented at [PAINT](https://2024.splashcon.org/home/paint-2024)
	- by Max Boksem and Thomas van Binsbergen
	- Summary: This article characterises and demonstrates a fundamentally graph-based programming environment: programs are built from explicitly-linked parts. This approach has benefits from two different, existing kinds of programming environment, which together make program parts easier to maintain and re-use.

2. On the Soundness of Auto-completion Services for Dynamically Typed Languages 
	- to be presented at [GPCE](https://2024.splashcon.org/home/gpce-2024)
	- by Damian Fr√∂lich and Thomas van Binsbergen
	- Summary: This article presents a novel mechanism for code editors to assist programmers by auto-suggesting identifiers. The novelty is that suggestions are based on an analysis of the program that is shallow enough to be fast and language-agnostic, but deep enough to guarantee suggestions are always valid.

3. Cooperative Specification via Composition Control
 	- to be presented at [SLE](https://2024.splashcon.org/track/sle-2024)
 	- by Christopher Esterhuyse and Thomas van Binsbergen
 	- Summary: This article presents a framework for using specification languages in a context where the specifications are developed from parts by cooperating agents. Some language features that are useful for this purpose are identified, and used to improve three existing specification languages
