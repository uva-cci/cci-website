<h2> Hi there!</h2>
<p>
I am currently working as a part-time research assistant. I work on a new interpreter for the <a href="https://gitlab.com/eflint">eFLINT programming language</a>. This server-side interpreter is meant to act as an efficient alternative to the reference interpreter in Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Next to being a research asistant, I am currently also a student here at the University of Amsterdam, attending the Software Engineering master.
