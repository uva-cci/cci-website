<h2> About Georgios</h2>
<p>
I am Georgios Tasopoulos and I have been working on my PhD in the Complex Cyber Infrastructure group since October 2023. I am also part of the SECURED European project where I am working on the optimisation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption techniques on the architectural and software level. Previously, I have worked for 2 years in Industrial Systems Institute / ATHENA Research Center (Patras, Greece), mainly focusing on Resource-Constrained Systems Security and Post-Quantum Cryptography. I am also an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Patras, Greece.
