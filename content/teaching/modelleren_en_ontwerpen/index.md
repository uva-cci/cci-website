The course Modelling and Design is focused on learning domain modelling, and how to create formalised representation. Whilst applying modelling techniques, a broader architectural view is taken, in which students are made aware of choices in e.g. framing and scoping. This course prepares students to exchange knowledge with domain stakeholders, and to communicate potential design decisions.
