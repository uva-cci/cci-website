Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex and autonomous ensembles of different components that
directly cooperate to offer smart and adaptive functionalities. The [CPS Summer School](https://www.cpsschool.eu/)
is targeted at students, research scientists and R&D experts from academia and industry, who want
to learn about CPS engineering and applications. This year's edition was held on the Italian island
of Sardinia, in the city of Alghero.
