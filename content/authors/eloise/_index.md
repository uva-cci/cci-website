<H2>About Eloise</H2>
<p>
My name is Eloise Zhang, and I'm currently working as a research assistant under the guidance of Dr. Zoltan Mann. Additionally, I am pursuing my master's degree in computer science. My research focuses on reducing power consumption during secure multi-party computation for privacy-preserving (deep) neural network inference. I'm also interested in fitting current MPC-NN inference system into edge computing environments.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking, practicing aerial yoga, and staying active through workouts. I'm also an influencer in nutrition and health, and always eager to engage in discussions about eating habits and share delicious recipes. So, if you share the same interests, let's connect and exchange ideas!
