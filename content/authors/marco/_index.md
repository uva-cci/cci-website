<h2>Hi, thanks for visiting!</h2>
<p>
I'm doing my PhD in the Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI) group, where I'm part of the <a href="https://sbd-research.nl/">Security By Design (SBD)</a> team under the supervision of <a href="/author/francesco-regazzoni">Francesco Regazzoni</a>. My goal is to make computer systems more secure by efficiently implementing security primitives in the computer architecture hardware, enabled by the rise of open-source Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) such as RISC-V.

As I was born and raised in Amsterdam, cycling is definitely my preferred method of transportation, and my lunch is not complete without a cheese sandwich. But I certainly want to do some experience abroad to broaden my horizon. I still like to play an occasional game of table tennis, so let me know if you know a good spot for this. Or if you want to play a chess game with the giant pieces at the ground floor, here at Science Park.
