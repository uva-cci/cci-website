As one of the three representing teams of our Informatics Institute at the Amsterdam
Science Park Open Day, CCI members Kyrian and Marco gave a demo on how scientists
hack hardware--in an effort to make it more secure, afterwards.

This was CCI's second participation in the Open Day. It was a great success, with
lots of families amazed by the FPGAs and hardware we showcased and the oscilloscope
showing waveforms.

## About the Open Day
The [Amsterdam Science Park Open Day](https://opendagamsterdamsciencepark.nl/)
is a collaboration of Amsterdam Science Park, AMOLF, ARCNL, CWI, Nikhef, and the
University of Amsterdam. It is part of the [*Weekend van de Wetenschap*](https://www.weekendvandewetenschap.nl/)
(Weekend of Science), held anually in the first weekend of October. The event is
an initiative of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, aimed to
make the world of science and technology accessible to people of all ages.
