<H2>About Adnan</H2>
<p>
  I am working as a Post-Doc researcher in CCI research group, focusing on how cloud and distributed systems can be described, measured, and operated in ways that support sustainability and long-term reproducibility. My work spans systems engineering, metadata modeling, sustainable, and energy-aware computing, with a focus on making complex research infrastructures easier to understand and improve.
</p>
<p>
  I develop models and processes that clarify how metrics, resources, and experiments are represented across heterogeneous environments. This reduces ambiguity, strengthens reproducibility, and enables automated analysis of performance, energy use, and interoperability.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, my work has centered on two questions: (1) how to expose consistent, meaningful metadata that supports cross-institutional collaboration, and (2) how to predict and optimize the energy footprint of workloads across cloud-to-edge systems in support of sustainable and reproducible research computing.
