In the Operating Systems course, students learn how applications 
interact with the hardware via the operating system, and how the 
operating system solves various tasks for the applications such as CPU 
scheduling, and memory and storage management.

Understanding these basics is very important to analyse and tune the 
performance of a system to a particular application. In the Complex 
Cyber Infrastructure group, we are often dealing with very high 
performance hardware, such as 400 Gbps fiber links, and large storage 
volumes. To have e.g. data-processing applications make full use of this 
hardware, requires tuning the operating system to the specific workload, 
and this is where the fundamental operating system knowledge comes in.
