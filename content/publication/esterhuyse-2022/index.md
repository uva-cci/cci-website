abstract: 'We report on the ideas and experiences of adapting Brane, a workflow execution framework, for use cases involving medical 
data exchange and processing. These use cases impose new requirements on the system to enforce policies encoding safety 
properties, ranging from access control to legal regulations pertaining to data privacy. Our approach emphasizes users' control 
over the extent to which they cooperate in distributed execution, at the cost of revealing information about their policies.'
