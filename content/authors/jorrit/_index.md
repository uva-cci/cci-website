<h2> Hi all!</h2>
<p>
I am currently working as a part-time researcher for the AMdEX project. For this I play around with dynamic microservice architectures. For my regular job I do cloud consultancy for a small firm where I help companies migrate and modernize towards modern cloud infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
I live in Utrecht, where I enjoy tennis and crossfit for sports, play an occasional video game and spend my time with friends.
